# Animal-Shogi-Bot

This project is an Animal Shogi bot written in C and Python. The Shogi bot uses a minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the next moves. The bot has levels of difficulty depending on how deep the bot searches the decision tree. It determines a score of the current playing field depending on the positions of each piece and material won.

A GUI based on Python is also added. The GUI in Python and driver code in C communicate to each other via file IO.
